Evidence is a web framework for data analysts. It's a modern alternative to drag-and-drop BI tools. 

Evidence enables analysts to build automated reports, analysis and tools that feel like they came from the graphics department at a top-tier publication. All with just SQL and markdown.

## How does it work? 
In Evidence, pages are just markdown files. When you write SQL statements inside code blocks in those files, Evidence runs that SQL against your data warehouse.

You can reference the results of those queries directly in your markdown document's text, or you can use them to make charts, graphs, and tables using the built-in component library. 

Evidence compiles those markdown documents into a fast and reliable website. It tests your queries and keeps the site up-to-date with your data warehouse.

Evidence supports loops, conditionals, parameterized pages, tests and more. It's easy to get started and you can build data products which are both more sophisticated and dramatically easier to use than what you can build with a typical BI tool.

## Who is it for? 
Evidence is built for analysts - not web developers. The only skills you need to get started are the ability to write SQL and markdown.
